# Web_Scraping

## Overview

Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. It allows users to gather information from multiple web pages and compile it into a structured format, such as CSV, JSON, or a database. This technique is widely used for various applications, including data analysis, market research, and competitive analysis.

## Why Web Scraping?

- **Data Collection**: Gather large amounts of data quickly from the web.
- **Market Research**: Analyze competitor pricing, product availability, and customer reviews.
- **Content Aggregation**: Collect articles, blogs, or product listings from different sites into one place.
- **Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks like form submissions or data entry.

## Tools for Web Scraping

There are various tools and libraries available for web scraping, each with its own strengths:

### 1. BeautifulSoup

- **Description**: BeautifulSoup is a Python library that provides simple methods and Pythonic idioms for navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree of HTML or XML documents.
- **Use Cases**: Ideal for scraping static web pages where the content is available in the HTML source. It works best when combined with requests to fetch the page content.
- **Installation**: 
  ```bash
  pip install beautifulsoup4
  pip install requests

### 2.Selenium
- **Description**: Selenium is a web automation tool that allows you to control a web browser programmatically. It is particularly useful for scraping dynamic web pages where content is loaded via JavaScript.
- **Use Cases**: Best suited for scraping websites that require interaction (like clicking buttons or filling forms) or that have dynamic content that is rendered after the page load.
-**Installation**:
  ```bash
  pip install selenium

- **You will also need a WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver) that matches your browser version.**
